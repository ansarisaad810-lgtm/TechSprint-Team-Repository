# Problem Statement

College campus management and student services are often fragmented.  
Students face difficulty in reporting issues, tracking attendance, or accessing study materials.  
Management struggles to monitor campus irregularities efficiently.  

**Goal:**  
Create a mobile app that consolidates these services in a single platform, enabling:  
- Quick reporting of campus issues  
- Attendance monitoring with analytics  
- Lost & Found management  
- Timetable and study material access
